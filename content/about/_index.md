Hello there! I'm Dishant Langayan, based in Ottawa, Canada, and this is my personal blog where I'm like to share my thoughts and opinions on anything technology related.

Over the past decade my career has taken many different paths with, [Solace](https://solace.com), the company I'm still working for: 

* 2011 - I started as a professional services consultant working on several investment banking projects, developing applications, designing and architecting solutions, and teaching customers about Solace products
* 2017 - I moved on to managing Solace's customer training and with 2 person team, we delivered trainings to all our customers across the globe. 
* 2018 - I got involved in building enablement programs for our sales teams and even helped sell our first [PubSub+ Cloud](https://solace.com/products/platform/cloud/) deal.
* 2019 - I grew my team to build onboarding programs for employees
* 2020 - Well everyone know what happened in 2020. I was busy building our company's first [certifition](https://solace.com/learn/certifications/).
* 2022 - I was promoted to VP and took on to manage our Business Operations team

Throughout my career, the developer inside my hasn't gone, and I still write code and build applications & integrations, sometimes for fun and sometimes for improving company operations.

When I'm not infront of a computer I love to [travel](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/TravelMap-a_uid.4D9E15C7214416E91BF484EFD77D3B4B) (there is so much to explore in this world) and maybe get some time on my guitar, which I learned during the pandemic.

I hope you enjoy the content I publish and share, and you can get in touch with me through [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dishantlangayan/)
